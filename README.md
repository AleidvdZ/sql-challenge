# Module 9 Pewlett Hackard Research Project 
The project consisted of analyzing employeed data for Pewlett Hackard starting from six csv files.  It included data modeling by creating an Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) to understand how the csv's were related, creating tables to hold the data and then analyzing the data in various ways.

## About
The task is to do a research project about people whom a fictitious company employed during the 1980s and 1990s. The information available about the employees from that period are six CSV files. The purpose is to design the tables to hold the data from the CSV files, import the CSV files into a SQL database, and then answer questions about the data. (paraphrased from Module 9 Challenge introduction in Bootcamp Spot (BCS).

## Process and Resources
1) Created ERD to show relatioships between the attributes (columns) in the entities (tables) in LucidChart
2) Created table schemas found in empl_table_schema.sql
3) Queries are located in empl_queries.sql

### Timeline
0626 Git repository created

0627 Challenge started. Looked at csv's and created some trial tables but need day 3 instruction to complete correctly with ERD and FOREIGN KEYS

0628 ERD started

0628 Created tables.  Had to add primary keys to 3 with ALTER TABLE

0628 Completed 4/8 data analysis requirments. 

0629 Completed the remaining data analysis requirements. Double checked tables and outputs.

## Examples
To test out tables they were run empty and again aftes csv was imported.

To test out/troubleshoot queries, smaller portions were run and/or compared to individual data outputs.
