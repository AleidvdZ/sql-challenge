# Project Title 
Brief project description 2-3 sentences.

## About
The task is to do a research project about people whom a fictitious company employed during the 1980s and 1990s. All that remains of the employee database from that period are six CSV files. The purpose is to design the tables to hold the data from the CSV files, import the CSV files into a SQL database, and then answer questions about the data. This includes performing data modeling, data engineering, and data analysis, respectively (paraphrased from Module 9 Challenge introduction in Bootcamp Spot (BCS).

## Process and Resources
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

1) Created ERD to show relatioships between the attributes (columns) in the entities (tables) in LucidChart
2) Created table schemas found in empl_table_schema.sql
3) Queries are located in empl_queries.sql

### Timeline
0626 Git repository created
0627 Challenge started. Looked at csv's and created some trial tables but need day 3 instruction to complete correctly with ERD and FOREIGN KEYS
0628 ERD started
0628 Created tables.  Had to add primary keys to 3 with ALTER TABLE
0628 Completed 4/8 Data Analysis requirments. Need to tweek one as it is returning more rows that active employees as they worked in multiple departments.

## Examples
A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running.

To test out tables they were run empty and again aftes csv was imported.
To test out/troubleshoot queries, smaller portions were run and/or compared to individual data outputs.
