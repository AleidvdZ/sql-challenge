# Project Title 
Brief project description 2-3 sentences.

## About
The task is to do a research project about people whom a fictitious company employed during the 1980s and 1990s. All that remains of the employee database from that period are six CSV files. The purpose is to design the tables to hold the data from the CSV files, import the CSV files into a SQL database, and then answer questions about the data. This includes performing data modeling, data engineering, and data analysis, respectively (paraphrased from Module 9 Challenge introduction in Bootcamp Spot (BCS).
